colorSchemeExplorer
===================

Color Scheme Explorer plugin for Vim

Color Scheme Explorer display a list of all available color schemes you have installed on your computer. Once opened, you are able to scroll through the list and select the color scheme of your choice. Once you have selected the color scheme you would like to see, your color scheme will change to reflect that scheme. If you would like to see another scheme, simply select a different one from the list. After you are done explorering all the color schemes, you can press 'q' to quick explorering...

By default the command to involke the Color Scheme Explorer is ':ColorSchemeExplorer''
