  - Download the colorSchemeExplorer.zip from one of the following places:
    https://github.com/jlanzarotta/colorSchemeExplorer
    http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1298
    or use a package manager like Vundle.
  - Extract the zip archive into your runtime directory.
    The archive contains plugin/colorSchemeExplorer.vim, and
    doc/colorSchemeExplorer.txt.
  - Start Vim or goto an existing instance of Vim.

USAGE                                                       *csexplorer-usage*

To start exploring, use: >
 :ColorSchemeExplorer

Command to use once exploring:

 <cr> or       Opens the currently select color scheme.
 <leftmouse>
 q             Quit exploring.
 ?             Displays help information.

Typically one would put csexplorer.vim into the .vim/plugin directory
(vimfiles\plugin for Windows) where it becomes automatically available
for use. It sets up it's default command :ColorSchemeExplorer.

Once invoked, Color Scheme Explorer display a list of all available color
schemes. You are then able to move the cursor to the line containing the color
scheme of choice. Once you have selected the color scheme you would like to
see, your color scheme will change to reflect that scheme. If you would like
to see another scheme, simply select a different one.

You can avoid loading this plugin by setting the "loaded_csExplorer"
variable: >
  :let loaded_csExplorer = 1
